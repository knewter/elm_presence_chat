# Elm Presence Chat

This is an elm application that interacts with Phoenix Channels via
[elm-phoenix-socket](https://github.com/fbonetti/elm-phoenix-socket).  If you
want to see the process to build it, I've created a [video and text walking
through the whole process.](https://www.dailydrip.com/topics/elm/drips/elm-phoenix-socket)

My work on `Elm<->Phoenix` integration is made possible by my company,
[DailyDrip](https://www.dailydrip.com).  If you like this project, you could
help me make more awesome stuff along these lines by checking out that site and
signing up for any topic that you think will be sufficiently awesome. :)
